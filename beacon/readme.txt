Each beacon transmits every three minutes, day and night.
(For two minutes of the three, a beacon is silent.  For one of the three minutes, a beacon is transmitting.)

This table gives the minute and second of the start of the first
transmission within the hour for each beacon on each frequency.

A transmission consists of the callsign of the beacon sent at 22 words
per minute followed by four one-second dashes.

The callsign and the first dash are sent at 100 watts. The remaining
dashes are sent at 10 watts, 1 watt and 100 milliwatts.
